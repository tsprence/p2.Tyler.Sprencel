Discussion of the design:
When starting this project I already had in mind a general idea of how a smart mirror should be designed, that being: minimalist and so intuitive that it can be operated without ever requiring the user to consult a manual. To achieve this, I made the design start with only five icons on the bottom of the mirror so that the user could choose to use them or ignore them entirely. If the icon is clicked, the mirror would then display a widget with the pertinent information, and to close it the user would simply click the red close icon that would appear on the icon that was originally clicked. All widgets will have the ability to be dragged across the mirror by the user.
